# Hirer Onboarding Guide

Audience
- Hirers (marketers/agencies/SMBs) acquiring a domain or slugs for campaigns.

Overview
1) Browse listings → 2) Select hire mode → 3) Checkout → 4) Configure routing → 5) Validate → 6) Launch → 7) Track and export

1) Browse and search
- Use filters by keyword/vertical/geo. Open a listing to view pricing, availability (exclusive vs shared slugs), and policies.

2) Choose hire mode
- Exclusive (entire domain) — monthly term; apex and www redirect to your target(s).
- Shared slugs — reserve one or many path slugs under an owner’s domain.

3) Checkout
- Period (monthly): pay a fixed price now; renew each month. Cancel before renewal.
- Per‑click (metered): start a usage plan; billed monthly for validated clicks; card on file required.

4) Configure routing
- Exclusive: set target URL for apex (example.com) and www. Choose redirect type.
- Shared slugs: add slugs (e.g., /offer, /city) and a target URL for each. Bulk upload supported.
- Redirect type: 302 temporary is recommended; 301 only if contractually permanent.
- UTM: we preserve your query parameters automatically.

5) Validate and launch
- Use the built‑in link checker to confirm 3xx response to your target and that query params are preserved.
- Toggle routes live when validation passes.

6) Analytics
- See validated clicks (bots filtered), geo/device/referrer summaries, and trends. Export CSV for your reporting.

7) Billing and renewals
- Period hires renew monthly on your billing date. Cancel before the next cycle in Billing → hires.
- Per‑click: invoices finalize monthly; charges occur automatically. View itemized usage on the invoice.

Disputes and credits
- If you suspect invalid traffic (IVT), open a dispute from Analytics → “Report a concern.” We review and credit validated IVT per policy.

Best practices
- Prefer 302 redirects unless you truly want a permanent move (301).
- Keep landing pages fast and mobile‑friendly; validate tracking tags.
- Use consistent UTM conventions so analytics align across systems.
