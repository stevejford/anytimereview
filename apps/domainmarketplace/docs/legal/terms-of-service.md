# Terms of Service (Draft)

Note: This draft is provided for product planning and should be reviewed by counsel before launch. It reflects a UGC marketplace and routing platform posture.

Last updated: 2025-10-18

1) Acceptance and Definitions
- By using the platform (the “Service”), you agree to these Terms.
- “Owner” lists a domain for hire. “Hirer” rents a domain or path slugs. “User Content” includes routing targets, landing pages, listings, and any materials you submit.
- We provide a marketplace and routing infrastructure. We are not a registrar and do not sell domains unless explicitly stated.

2) Service Description; Marketplace Role
- The Service enables Owners to list domains and Hirers to rent them for campaigns (exclusive or via slugs). We provide DNS onboarding guidance, edge routing (HTTP redirects), analytics, and payments tooling.
- We do not host Hirer landing pages. Hirers are responsible for their content and destinations.
- We may provide temporary or permanent redirect options; SEO outcomes are not guaranteed.

3) Accounts and Eligibility
- You must be at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction and able to form a binding contract.
- You agree to provide accurate information and maintain the security of your account. We may require KYC through our payment processor.

4) Listings and hires
- Owners represent they control the domain and may configure DNS for routing. Owners agree to cooperate with verification (TXT/HTTP/Domain Connect) and safe cutover.
- Hirers set routing targets and redirect type (e.g., 302). Hirers warrant they have rights to all content and destinations and will comply with the AUP.
- We may suspend or modify routing to address abuse, legal claims (e.g., DMCA/UDRP), security, or platform integrity.

5) Fees, Payments, and Taxes
- We use Stripe Connect for payouts to Owners. We charge a platform fee (currently 4% of gross), and Stripe processing fees apply per flow.
- Period hires: typically processed as Direct Charges to Owner’s connected account with an application fee to the platform.
- Per‑click hires: billed as metered usage to the Hirer; Owner payouts are transfers of the gross less platform fee and any adjustments.
- You authorize us and our processors to charge your payment method. We may place reserves/holds to manage risk.
- Taxes are your responsibility. Where required, we will collect and remit taxes, or request tax information from you.

6) Refunds, Credits, and Disputes
- Refunds for period hires are limited. Pro‑rata credits may be offered for platform‑caused downtime per published SLAs.
- For metered billing, we credit validated invalid traffic (IVT) per policy. Disputes must be submitted within the stated window.
- Chargebacks: you must provide accurate information. We may deduct dispute losses from payouts.

7) Acceptable Use; Prohibited Conduct
- You must follow our Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Prohibited uses include illegal content, IP infringement, malware, phishing, spam, deceptive or harmful redirects, and other high‑risk categories listed in the AUP.
- Traffic manipulation (e.g., click fraud, bots) is prohibited. We apply bot/IVT filters and may adjust usage.

8) Intellectual Property; DMCA
- You retain rights in your User Content. You grant us a non‑exclusive license to use, host, cache, display, and transmit your User Content as necessary to operate the Service.
- We follow a notice‑and‑takedown process under the DMCA. See our DMCA Policy for how to submit notices and counter‑notices.

9) Third‑Party Services and Processors
- The Service integrates with third parties (e.g., Cloudflare, Stripe, Neon, Resend). Their terms and privacy practices apply to your use of those services.

10) Privacy
- Our Privacy Policy explains what data we collect and how we use it, including click analytics and payment information. By using the Service, you consent to our processing as described there.

11) Disclaimers
- The Service is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.” We disclaim warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement.
- We do not guarantee any SEO outcomes, rankings, or traffic performance.

12) Limitation of Liability
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither we nor our suppliers are liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages.
- Our total liability for claims arising from or relating to the Service will not exceed the greater of (a) amounts you paid to us in the three months preceding the claim or (b) USD $100.

13) Indemnification
- You will indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising out of your User Content, your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of laws/rights of others.

14) Suspension and Termination
- We may suspend or terminate access for violations of these Terms, AUP, non‑payment, fraud, legal requests, or risk to the Service. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you when appropriate.

15) Disputes; Governing Law
- These Terms are governed by [Jurisdiction/State/Country] law, without regard to conflict‑of‑law rules.
- Any dispute will be resolved in [venue/arbitration forum]. You waive class actions to the extent permitted by law.
