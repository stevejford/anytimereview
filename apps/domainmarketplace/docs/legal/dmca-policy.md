Note: This draft must be reviewed by counsel. For U.S. services, designate an agent with the U.S. Copyright Office to qualify for safe harbor.

1) Designated Agent (placeholder)
- Name: [Company/Agent Name]
- Address: [Street, City, State, ZIP]
- Email: [dmca@example.com]

2) Submitting a Takedown Notice
- If you believe content accessible via a domain or slug routed through our Service infringes your copyright, send a notice including:
  - Your physical or electronic signature.
  - Identification of the copyrighted work you claim is infringed.
  - Identification of the material claimed to be infringing (URL(s)).
  - Your contact information (address, phone, email).
  - A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
  - A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information is accurate and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner.
- Send to the Designated Agent above.

3) Our Response
- We will process valid notices and may disable or remove access to the allegedly infringing routing or content.
- We will notify the affected user with a copy of the notice and information about submitting a counter‑notice.

4) Counter‑Notice
- If you believe your content was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, send a counter‑notice including:
  - Your physical or electronic signature.
  - Identification of the material removed and its prior location (URL(s)).
  - A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.
  - Your name, address, phone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for your address (or any judicial district in which the service provider may be found if outside the U.S.), and that you will accept service of process from the person who sent the original notice or their agent.
- Send to the Designated Agent above.
- Upon receipt of a valid counter‑notice, we may restore the material in 10–14 business days unless the original complainant informs us they filed an action to seek a court order.

5) Repeat Infringer Policy
- We may terminate accounts and/or remove listings for users determined to be repeat infringers.
- We also reserve the right to remove content or disable routing for alleged infringement at our discretion.

6) Important
- We are a routing platform and marketplace; we do not host user landing pages. Notices should identify specific URLs and content at the destination pages.
