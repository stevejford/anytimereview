# UDRP Workflow

Note: We are not the registrar and do not control domain ownership transfers. We facilitate routing. This workflow addresses complaints that a listed or rented domain allegedly violates a third partyâ€™s rights.

1) Intake
- Accept complaints and notices from approved UDRP providers or counsel. Log ticket with domain, complainant, provider reference, and deadlines.

2) Verification
- Verify the domain is listed on the platform and identify the Owner and any active Rentals.
- Confirm whether we can modify routing (we do) vs. domain ownership (we do not).

3) Initial Action (Hold/Suspension)
- Place a hold on the listing and suspend routing for contested labels (domain and slugs) while we review, unless otherwise directed by provider.
- Preserve logs and records (routes, click logs, communications).

4) Notifications
- Notify the Owner and active Renters of the complaint and the hold. Provide basic information and timeline.
- Provide a copy of the complaint where permissible.

5) Cooperation
- Respond to the provider with our platform role (marketplace/routing) and point of contact.
- Follow provider instructions regarding technical measures (e.g., disabling routing) pending outcome.

6) Outcome Handling
- If the panel orders transfer/cancellation: the registrar executes. We maintain suspension of routing and update listing status accordingly.
- If complaint is denied/withdrawn: we may restore routing and listing status.

7) Records and Timelines
- Retain all related materials and logs. Target initial response within 2 business days; adjust per provider deadlines.

8) Policy References
- ICANN UDRP and provider rules; Terms of Service; Acceptable Use Policy.
