# Specialist Agents — Working Agreement

- Objective: Each specialist produces the deliverables listed in the main report under “Specialist Agent Plan.”
- Style: Concise, source-linked, actionable. Prefer checklists, diagrams, and SOPs.
- Sources: Use primary vendor docs and recognized standards (IAB, MRC, ICANN, Google).
- Acceptance: Every doc must include (1) purpose, (2) scope, (3) decisions/recommendations, (4) implementation steps, (5) risks, (6) references.
- Review: Cross-review by adjacent roles (e.g., Security reviews IVT policy; Legal reviews TOS/Privacy).

Documentation workers
- Worker specs live in `docs/agents/workers`. Each file defines inputs, outputs, steps, and acceptance criteria for a specialist.
- Track progress in `docs/agents/tracking.md`.
- Start by opening the relevant `*.worker.md`, follow the steps, and deliver into the specified output files.
