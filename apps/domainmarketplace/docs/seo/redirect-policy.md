# Redirect Policy & SEO

Principles
- Temporary hires → 302/307; preserve query; avoid equity transfer.
- Permanent/exclusive (contracted) → 301/308; documented site move.
- Hosted micro-pages → canonical to hirer primary URL; robots control per contract.

Crawler handling
- Respect IAB bots list; exclude from analytics; allow crawling unless policy forbids.
